**This projects was part of my graduation's final year project. It is a web application that can predict the upcomming stock market trend using RNN-LSTM neural network and advises wether to buy or sell stocks from the specific company.**
### Problem Statement
> “The Stock Market is chaotic and unpredictable where any slight fluctuation in supply and demand will affect stock prices. The future stock market prices are therefore ambiguous and highly volatile and there is a need for predicting the future stock prices and fluctuations accurately.”
